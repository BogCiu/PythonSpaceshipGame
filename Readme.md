This game was my way of starting to learn the pygame module.
In this state of the project the spaceships don't have a lifebar (there is not win condition, the game continues forever)
However, the collision is complete (notice when you shoot the spaceship, the bullet dissapears instead of going through it)

Controls:
    Left Player : W,A,S,D, LCtrl
    Right Player : Up,Down,Left,Right, RCtrl

Each player can only have a maximum of 3 bullets on screen.

TODO:
    Add health bar
    Fashion everything in OOP design -- right now, variables are global and unrelated to eachother, 
                                        and functions are defined for each ship, rather than a "Spaceship" object.
                                        
    And..uhm... learn more ðŸ˜Š
